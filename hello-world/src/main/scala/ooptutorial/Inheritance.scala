    // there are ways to prevent overrides
    // 1. using "final". It prevent derived classes from overriding the original method
    // 2. final can be used on the class itself - it prevents entire class from extending
    //      numerical classes in Scala are final for example
    // 3. seal the class - we can extend classes in THIS FILE, but prevents extension in other classes
